		I'd be interested in learning about XML-based nosql databases – I've seen them used in a pretty diverse number of applications and they seem useful.

		I feel like ASP.NET can feel a bit disorganized. The fact that the compiled program automatically matches controllers to views based on names is really nice – but I do find myself missing the urls.py from Django. They provide an at-a-glance outline of an app's routes, something that's a lot harder to visuaize with the route attributes here, and it feels a lot more modular.
